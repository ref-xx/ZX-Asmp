Hello forever XIII!

aSMP demo - 48k only
Tested on real 48k with Divide and various time sensitive emulators: Specemu, Ziggy & Zx Spin.

What's this?
This is a proof of concept demo for working around the limit of 18 character wide multicolour screen. it's called aSMP ("A Selective Multicolour Picture"!) Last year I got an idea of breaking 18 mlt column limit of zx spectrum. I wrote a simple roadmap on wos forums, and we decided, in theory, it might be possible. This week, I started coding a tool for conversion, aiming for my fav demoparty, forever. Sadly the tool is not finished, but it converts just fine. This is the result of this coding session. 

The picture is my testing picture when I work on the idea. I couldn't find time to draw unique pixels for this mode's debut, sorry for it's a modified convert picture. 

Nothing fancy really, but this mode can scatter multicolour blocks anywhere on screen, thus enhancing a standard blocky display. I will release the conversion tool (windows based) very soon (with 128k support!)

This is a rush release for forever, 
thank you for reading this!
